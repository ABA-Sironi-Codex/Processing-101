#### Code

``` java
// You already know the first lines

size(600, 200);
strokeWeight(4);

/*
A "line" (which it would be more correct
to call segment) is defined by 4 values:
the X and Y coordinates of its point of 
origin and those of its point of end.
*/

line(100, 50, 500, 50);
line(100, 150, 500, 150);


/*
//Let's change pencils and add more lines
stroke(#791F33);
strokeWeight(4);

line(100, 50, 100, 150);
line(100, 50, 200, 150);
line(100, 50, 300, 150);
line(100, 50, 400, 150);

line(200, 50, 500, 150);
line(300, 50, 500, 150);
line(400, 50, 500, 150);
line(500, 50, 500, 150);
