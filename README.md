# Processing 101

This repository contains all the materials from my courses on [Processing](https://processing.org/). The repository is organized in the form of an Obsidian Vault, so you should get [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) first and then open the main directory as a *vault*.

The repository contains sketches made by me, other authors and my students. Credits are always given in the accompanying notes.

The largest contributions are those of:

- [HiddenEnigma's "365 Processing" repository](https://github.com/hiddenenigma/365Processing) (last pull: august 2022)
- [Tsulej's "GenerateMe" repository](https://github.com/tsulej/GenerateMe#processing-3)Â (last pull: august 2022).
