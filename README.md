Learning Processing
=================

A huge [Processing](https://processing.org/) sketches collection that I use in creative coding courses at the [Academy of Fine Arts of Urbino](http://www.accademiadiurbino.it), [ISIA Faenza](http://isiafaenza.it), [ISIA Urbino](http://isiaurbino.net), in Italy.

All the included sketches and materials of other authors have been released through various open source licenses: all archives always report the author's name and the link to the official site.

Other useful resources are available in [wiki](https://github.com/davideriboli/Creative-Coding-with-Processing/wiki).
