#### Code

- [References](https://processing.org/reference/)

``` java
void setup() {
  size(200, 200);
  background(255, 0, 0);
}

void draw() {
  fill(0);
  rect(mouseX, mouseY, 50, 50);
}

/*
Without adding a single line of code,
what should you do to paint the entire
background in black, moving the mouse?
*/

```
