#### Code

- [References](https://processing.org/reference/)

``` java
/*
Triangles and rectangles are not too difficult.

The triangles are defined by six values: the X and Y coordinates of their vertices.

The rectangles by four: the X and Y coordinates of the origin point, the width and the height. Remember that rectangles, like ellipses, also have a "rectMode" instruction.
*/

size(600, 600);

triangle(96, 300, 200, 80, 300, 300);

//rectMode(CENTER);

rect(300, 300, 50, 50);
